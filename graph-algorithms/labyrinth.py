]

explore(grid, 1, 1)  # Start exploration from position (1, 1)

# Print final grid
for row in grid:
    print(row)

# ðŸ§  Output Explanation
# After running explore(grid, 1, 1), it will:

# Visit all 0s that are connected to position (1, 1) by 4-way movement (no diagonals).

# Convert them to 2 to mark them as visited.

# Ignore 1s (walls) and stay within the bounds of the grid.
