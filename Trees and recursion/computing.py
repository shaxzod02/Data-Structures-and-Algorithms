#âœ… Explanation:
# count_nodes(node) counts all nodes in the subtree rooted at node, including the node itself.

# count_height(node) computes the height of the tree. A single node has height 0. If it has children, height increases based on the depth of the deepest child.

# The logging version of count_nodes() gives insight into the recursive flow and helps visualize subtree sizes.
