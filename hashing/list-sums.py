def count_sublists(numbers, x):
    count = {0: 1}  # Initialize a dictionary to store prefix sums and their counts. Start with {0: 1} to handle the case where the sum itself is exactly x.
    prefix_sum = 0   # Initialize the running prefix sum to 0
    result = 0        # Initialize the result to store the number of sublists with sum equal to 'x'
    
    for i in range(len(numbers)):  # Iterate through the numbers list by index
        prefix_sum += numbers[i]  # Update the running sum (prefix sum) by adding the current number
        
        # Check if there exists a prefix sum that, when subtracted from the current prefix sum, equals 'x'
        if prefix_sum - x in count:
            result += count[prefix_sum - x]  # Add the count of those prefix sums to the result
        
        # If the current prefix sum is not already in the dictionary, add it with an initial count of 0
        if prefix_sum not in count:
            count[prefix_sum] = 0
        
        # Increment the count of the current prefix sum in the dictionary
        count[prefix_sum] += 1
        
    return result  # Return the total number of sublists where the sum is equal to 'x'

# Explanation:
# count dictionary: This stores the count of each prefix sum encountered during the iteration. It helps track how many times a specific prefix sum has appeared in the list, which is crucial for determining the number of valid sublists.

# We start with {0: 1} because a prefix sum of 0 (no elements) should be considered once to handle cases where the sum of a sublist starting from the beginning equals x.

# prefix_sum: This is the running sum of the elements from the start of the list up to the current index. It helps us efficiently calculate sublists by comparing the current sum with previous sums.

# result: This variable stores the total number of sublists whose sum equals x. Every time we find a valid sublist, we increment result.

# Main logic:

# For each element in the list, we update the prefix_sum.

# We then check if the difference between the current prefix_sum and x exists in the count dictionary. If it does, it means that there are previous prefix sums which, when subtracted from the current prefix sum, yield x. This implies the sum of the sublist between these prefix sums equals x.

# We update the count dictionary with the new prefix_sum to keep track of how many times it has appeared.

numbers = [1, 2, 3]
x = 3
# Process:

# At index 0, prefix_sum is 1. We update count = {0: 1, 1: 1}.

# At index 1, prefix_sum is 3. We check prefix_sum - x = 3 - 3 = 0 in count. It exists (count = 1), so we increment result = 1. Update count = {0: 1, 1: 1, 3: 1}.

# At index 2, prefix_sum is 6. We check prefix_sum - x = 6 - 3 = 3 in count. It exists (count = 1), so we increment result = 2. Update count = {0: 1, 1: 1, 3: 1, 6: 1}.

result = 2
