#First Version: Recursive/Backtracking Approach
def find_coins(x):
    solutions = [[]]
    
    for solution in solutions:
        if sum(solution) == x:
            return len(solution)
        for coin in [1, 2, 5]:
            solutions.append(solution + [coin])

# Explanation:
# Problem: This version tries to find all possible ways to make the amount x using coins of values 1, 2, and 5, and returns the length of the first valid solution (i.e., the number of coins used).

# Logic:

# Start with an empty solution solutions = [[]] (a list containing one empty list).

# For each solution (this is how we begin exploring possibilities), if the sum of coins in that solution equals x, return the number of coins used (i.e., len(solution)).

# For each coin in [1, 2, 5], add it to the current solution and append the new solution to solutions.

# However, this approach has some significant issues:

# Efficiency: This approach doesn't necessarily find the minimum number of coins first; it might take a very long time since it's generating all possible combinations, including many invalid ones.

# No early stopping: Once the solution is found, it doesn't stop immediately and keeps checking other possibilities.

# Not optimal: It doesn't optimize for the minimum number of coins.

# Second Version: Greedy Approach:
def find_coins(x):
    count = 0
    for coin in [5, 2, 1]:
        while coin <= x:
            x -= coin
            count += 1
    return count

# Explanation:
# Problem: This version uses a greedy approach to find the minimum number of coins to make the amount x by always picking the largest possible coin first.

# Logic:

# Start with count = 0 to keep track of the number of coins.

# For each coin type in [5, 2, 1], keep subtracting the coin's value from x as long as x is greater than or equal to the coin's value.

# For each subtraction, increment the coin count.

# This approach works well when the coin denominations are multiples of each other (as they are here with 1, 2, and 5), but it might fail with other coin systems that aren't structured in this way.

# Issues:
# Greedy Limitation: The greedy algorithm doesn't always give the optimal solution for all coin denominations. For example, if the coin denominations were [1, 3, 4] and x = 6, the greedy algorithm would pick one 4 and then one 2, which isn't optimal. The optimal solution would be two 3s.

# Optimal for the given coin denominations: For the specific case of coin denominations 1, 2, and 5, this greedy approach will always provide the correct result.

# Conclusion:
# The first approach (recursive/backtracking) is not the most efficient or optimal for this problem and should be avoided for large values of x due to excessive computation and lack of optimization.

# The second approach (greedy) is efficient and works perfectly with the coin denominations 1, 2, and 5 but may fail with other, more complex sets of denominations.

# Improving the Solution:
# If you want to ensure correctness for all cases, you should use a dynamic programming approach, which guarantees finding the minimum number of coins. Here's how it would look:

# Dynamic Programming Solution:
def find_coins(x):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (x + 1)  # Create a list to store the minimum coins for each amount
    dp[0] = 0  # Base case: zero coins needed for amount 0
    
    coins = [1, 2, 5]  # Available coin denominations
    
    # Loop through all amounts from 1 to x
    for amount in range(1, x + 1):
        for coin in coins:
            if amount >= coin:
                dp[amount] = min(dp[amount], dp[amount - coin] + 1)
                
    return dp[x] if dp[x] != float('inf') else -1  # Return the result or -1 if no solution is found

# Explanation of Dynamic Programming:
# dp[i] represents the minimum number of coins needed to make amount i.

# We initialize dp[0] = 0 because zero coins are needed for amount 0.

# We then iterate through all amounts from 1 to x and for each coin denomination, we update dp[amount] to ensure it stores the minimum number of coins needed for that amount.

# The final answer will be in dp[x], which will store the minimum number of coins needed to make the amount x. If no solution exists, it returns -1.
