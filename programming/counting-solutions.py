# The count_coins function you've provided is an implementation of the coin change problem, where the goal is to determine how many different ways you can make a sum x using a set of coins with different denominations. This is a well-known dynamic programming problem, often referred to as the Unbounded Knapsack or Coin Change problem.

# Explanation of the Code:
# Initialization:

# The dictionary result is used to store the number of ways to make each amount from 0 to x.

# We initialize result[0] = 1 because there is exactly one way to make 0: using no coins.

# Dynamic Programming Loop:

# For each amount s from 1 to x, we initialize result[s] = 0 because initially, we assume no way to form that amount.

# For each coin, if subtracting the coin's value from s results in a non-negative value (s - coin >= 0), we add result[s - coin] to result[s]. This means that if there are ways to make s - coin, then by adding the coin coin, we can form s.

# Final Output:

# After iterating through all amounts, result[x] contains the number of ways to make x using the available coins.

# Example Walkthrough:
# For x = 13 and coins [1, 2, 5]:

# The function computes the number of ways to make 13 using the available coins, considering all combinations of 1s, 2s, and 5s.

# Output:
print(count_coins(13, [1, 2, 5]))  # 634
# Explanation:

# There are 634 different ways to make the sum 13 using coins 1, 2, and 5.
print(count_coins(13, [1, 4, 5]))  # 88

# Explanation:

# There are 88 different ways to make the sum 13 using coins 1, 4, and 5.
print(count_coins(42, [1, 5, 6, 17]))  # 1103532
# Explanation:

# There are 1,103,532 different ways to make the sum 42 using coins 1, 5, 6, and 17.

# Code:
def count_coins(x, coins):
    result = {}
    
    # Base case: There is one way to make 0 (using no coins)
    result[0] = 1

    # For each amount from 1 to x
    for s in range(1, x + 1):
        result[s] = 0
        # Check every coin to see if it can contribute to the amount s
        for coin in coins:
            if s - coin >= 0:
                result[s] += result[s - coin]
                
    # Return the total number of ways to make amount x
    return result[x]

print(count_coins(13, [1, 2, 5]))  # 634
print(count_coins(13, [1, 4, 5]))  # 88
print(count_coins(42, [1, 5, 6, 17]))  # 1103532
# Time Complexity:
# The outer loop runs for all amounts from 1 to x, so O(x).

# The inner loop iterates over all coins, so O(m), where m is the number of coins.

# Thus, the overall time complexity is O(x * m), where x is the target amount and m is the number of available coin denominations.

# Space Complexity:
# We are storing the number of ways to make each amount from 0 to x, so the space complexity is O(x).

# Example Test Outputs:
# For count_coins(13, [1, 2, 5]), the function will output 634, meaning there are 634 ways to form the amount 13 using the coins 1, 2, and 5.

# For count_coins(13, [1, 4, 5]), the function will output 88, meaning there are 88 ways to form the amount 13 using the coins 1, 4, and 5.

# For count_coins(42, [1, 5, 6, 17]), the function will output 1103532, meaning there are 1,103,532 ways to form the amount 42 using the coins 1, 5, 6, and 17.
