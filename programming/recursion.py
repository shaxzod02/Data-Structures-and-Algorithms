# Explanation of Both Approaches:
# 1. Recursive with Memoization (count_sequences(n, d=0, result={}))
# This version uses recursion with memoization to compute the number of valid sequences.

# It tries to count valid sequences where n is the number of steps or actions, and d tracks the direction (or depth) of the sequence.

# The sequence starts from d = 0, and we can increase or decrease the value of d by 1 at each step.

# The base case is when n == 0, which returns 1 if the sequence is valid (i.e., d == 0), meaning the sequence reaches the final state.

# Memoization (stored in result) avoids redundant calculations and speeds up the process.

# 2. Dynamic Programming Version (count_sequences(n))
# This version uses a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of valid sequences.

# It builds a table (result) where result[(i, j)] represents the number of valid sequences of length i and depth j.

# The recurrence relations are:

# If j + 1 <= n, add the result from result[(i - 1, j + 1)].

# If j - 1 >= 0, add the result from result[(i - 1, j - 1)].

# The solution to the problem is stored in result[(n, 0)], which gives the number of valid sequences of length n with a final depth of 0.

# Issues and Considerations:
# Recursion Limit (sys.setrecursionlimit(5000)):

# The recursion depth may be too large for deep recursion (e.g., count_sequences(2000)) in the first implementation, so you are increasing the recursion limit to allow more recursive calls.

# However, this can lead to performance issues and stack overflows if the problem is large enough. This is why the second approach using dynamic programming is preferred for large n.

# Performance:

# Recursive Approach with Memoization: The recursive approach can be inefficient when n is very large because it has a lot of redundant recursive calls, even with memoization. For extremely large values of n, it may run into performance bottlenecks and reach the recursion limit.

# Dynamic Programming Approach: This approach uses a table to store intermediate results, making it more efficient and avoiding the recursion depth problem. It's better for large n because it avoids redundant calculations and iterates over n once.

# Memory Usage:

# The dynamic programming version uses more memory because it builds a 2D table (result[(i, j)]), while the recursive approach with memoization only stores results for specific (n, d) pairs as needed. However, for large n, the dynamic programming version is still likely more efficient.

# Performance of count_sequences(2000):
# Given the large number 2000 for n, the recursive approach may take too long or hit recursion depth limits, especially when calculating such large values. The dynamic programming approach, on the other hand, is more feasible for large inputs because it uses an iterative method instead of recursion.

# Optimization for Large n:
# If you want to calculate count_sequences(2000), the dynamic programming version is far more efficient. It should not face the recursion depth issues and is expected to run without a problem for n = 2000.

# Possible Output for count_sequences(2000):
# Since the problem involves a large number of computations (especially with values like n = 2000), it would take significant time to calculate. However, the dynamic programming method should be capable of calculating this without encountering recursion depth issues.

# Example Execution:
# Dynamic programming version of count_sequences(n)
def count_sequences(n):
    result = {}
    result[(0, 0)] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result[(0, i)] = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(0, n + 1):
            result[(i, j)] = 0
            if j + 1 <= n:
                result[(i, j)] += result[(i - 1, j + 1)]
            if j - 1 >= 0:
                result[(i, j)] += result[(i - 1, j - 1)]
    return result[(n, 0)]

# Running for n = 2000 (this might take a while, depending on the size)
print(count_sequences(2000))
