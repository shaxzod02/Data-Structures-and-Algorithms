# Your updated min_coins function now returns the actual coin denominations used to form the target value x, rather than just the count of coins. Here's a breakdown of how the new implementation works:

# Key Changes:
# Storing Coins: Instead of storing the minimum number of coins in the result dictionary, you are now storing the actual coin combination (a list of coins) that gives the minimum number of coins.

# Result Update: For each amount s, when a coin is used, the new_result is generated by adding the current coin to the solution for s - c. If this new combination is smaller than the previous one (in terms of number of coins), it replaces the old combination.

# Explanation:
# Initialization: The dictionary result[0] = [] initializes the case where the target value is 0, and no coins are required.

# Dynamic Programming: For each amount from 1 to x, the function iterates over all the coins and checks whether including a coin results in a smaller combination of coins.

# Optimal Solution: For each amount s, the best combination of coins (the one with the least number of coins) is stored.

# Example Walkthrough:
# For x = 13 and coins [1, 2, 5]:

# The optimal combination is [5, 5, 2, 1] since it uses 4 coins.

# The coins are returned in a sorted order, i.e., [1, 2, 5, 5].

# Output:
print(min_coins(13, [1, 2, 5]))  # [1, 2, 5, 5]
# Explanation:

# For x = 13, the optimal combination is [5, 5, 2, 1], which results in a sorted list [1, 2, 5, 5].
print(min_coins(13, [1, 4, 5]))  # [4, 4, 5]

# Explanation:

# For x = 13, the optimal combination is [5, 4, 4], and the sorted list is [4, 4, 5].

print(min_coins(42, [1, 5, 6, 17]))  # [1, 1, 6, 17, 17]
# Explanation:

# For x = 42, the optimal combination is [17, 17, 6, 1, 1], and the sorted list is [1, 1, 6, 17, 17].

# Code:
def min_coins(x, coins):
    result = {}
 
    result[0] = []  # No coins needed for amount 0
    for s in range(1, x + 1):
        result[s] = [1] * s  # Start with a large number of coins (worst case)
        for c in coins:
            if s - c >= 0:
                new_result = result[s - c] + [c]
                if len(new_result) < len(result[s]):
                    result[s] = new_result
 
    return sorted(result[x])  # Return the coin combination in sorted order

print(min_coins(13, [1, 2, 5]))  # [1, 2, 5, 5]
print(min_coins(13, [1, 4, 5]))  # [4, 4, 5]
print(min_coins(42, [1, 5, 6, 17]))  # [1, 1, 6, 17, 17]

# Complexity:
# Time Complexity: O(x * m) where x is the target value, and m is the number of coin denominations. For each amount s, we check all coins.

# Space Complexity: O(x) for storing the coin combinations for all amounts from 0 to x.
