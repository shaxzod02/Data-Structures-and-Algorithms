# 1. First Implementation: Counting Sequences with Dynamic Direction (count_sequences(n, d)):
# This implementation counts sequences that follow a certain rule. Specifically, it seems to count valid sequences of moves, where at each step the direction can either increase or decrease by 1. The approach uses recursion, with an additional parameter d to track the current direction of the sequence.

# How it works:
# d is the current direction of the sequence, and it can either increase or decrease.

# When d is less than 0 or greater than n, the sequence is invalid.

# When n reaches 0, it returns 1, indicating that a valid sequence has been formed.

# The result is computed using a recursive formula that considers both directions:
# return count_sequences(n - 1, d + 1) + count_sequences(n - 1, d - 1)

# Optimized with Memoization:
# In the second function, memoization is added. This optimization prevents redundant calculations by storing the results for specific values of n and d in the result dictionary.

# 2. Second Implementation: Counting Balanced Sequences (count_sequences(n)):
# The third count_sequences(n) function is solving a different problem. It seems to count how many ways we can form sequences of valid moves (possibly balanced sequences), given that we can break n into smaller subproblems and solve them recursively.

# Key Changes:
# The recurrence relation now considers possible "pairings" (combinations of two values). The sequence can be split into two parts, and the problem is recursively solved by splitting at every even index i:
# count += count_sequences(i - 2) * count_sequences(n - i)
# Here, the sequence is split into two parts: one of size i - 2 and another of size n - i.

# How It Works:
# It recursively counts the valid ways to form balanced sequences by breaking down the problem into subproblems and solving each part independently.

# Memoization is used to store the results for each n to avoid recalculating the same values multiple times.

# Example of Output:
# For the sequence count_sequences(100), the function outputs a large number. This count is the result of breaking down the sequence into smaller balanced parts and recursively solving it.

# Code with Comments:
# Here is a cleaned-up version of your code with additional comments for better clarity.
# First version: Counting sequences with direction tracking (dynamic increase and decrease)
def count_sequences_with_direction(n, d=0, result={}):
    if d < 0 or d > n:
        return 0  # Invalid sequence if direction goes out of bounds
    if n == 0:
        return 1  # A valid sequence found when n is zero
    if (n, d) not in result:  # Memoize the result to avoid redundant calculations
        result[(n, d)] = count_sequences_with_direction(n - 1, d + 1, result) + \
                         count_sequences_with_direction(n - 1, d - 1, result)
    return result[(n, d)]

# Example usage
print(count_sequences_with_direction(100))  # Expected output: A very large number

# Second version: Counting valid balanced sequences (split approach)
def count_sequences_balanced(n, result={}):
    if n == 0:
        return 1  # Base case: One way to form a sequence of length 0
    if n not in result:  # Memoize the result to avoid redundant calculations
        count = 0
        for i in range(2, n + 1, 2):  # Loop over even values to divide the sequence
            count += count_sequences_balanced(i - 2, result) * \
                     count_sequences_balanced(n - i, result)
        result[n] = count
    return result[n]

# Example usage
print(count_sequences_balanced(13))  # Expected output: Number of valid balanced sequences for 13

# Explanation:
# Memoization: In both implementations, results are stored in the result dictionary to avoid redundant calculations for the same input values. This significantly improves performance, especially for larger inputs.

# Recursion: Both functions use recursion to break down the problem into smaller subproblems. The second function also splits the problem at each even index i and uses the results of smaller problems to form the final solution.

# Performance: Without memoization, the functions would perform a lot of redundant calculations and could become inefficient for large inputs. With memoization, we reduce the time complexity by ensuring each subproblem is solved only once.

# Time Complexity:
# For count_sequences_with_direction: The time complexity is dependent on n and d, but memoization ensures each combination of (n, d) is computed once, making it much more efficient than the naive recursive approach.

# For count_sequences_balanced: This approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested recursion over the even i values, but memoization ensures that each unique n is computed only once.
