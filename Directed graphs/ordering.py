#âœ… Example Usage:
t = TopologicalSort([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])

# Add directed edges to the graph
t.add_edge(1, 2)
t.add_edge(2, 3)
t.add_edge(3, 6)
t.add_edge(4, 1)
t.add_edge(4, 5)
t.add_edge(5, 2)
t.add_edge(5, 3)

# Compute and print topological sort order
print(t.create())  # Expected output: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 6]
