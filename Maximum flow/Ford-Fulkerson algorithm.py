# Flow Initialization: In the MaximumFlow class, the self.flow dictionary is initialized incorrectly when copying the graph. It needs to be initialized with zero flow for every edge at the start.

# Inconsistent Flow Calculation: The method add_flow doesn't seem to use a proper residual graph approach for calculating the flow, which is key in algorithms like Ford-Fulkerson (which the code seems to attempt to implement).

# I'll walk through the general principles and then correct the code accordingly.

# Maximum Flow Algorithm (Ford-Fulkerson)
# The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm works by repeatedly searching for augmenting paths (paths where there is remaining capacity along the edges) and increasing the flow along those paths. The steps are:

# Initialize Flow: Start with all flows as zero.

# Find Augmenting Path: Repeatedly find a path from the source to the sink where the capacity is greater than zero along all edges in the path (called an augmenting path).

# Update Residual Graph: For each augmenting path found, update the flow along the path and the residual capacities.

# Repeat: Keep doing this until no augmenting paths can be found.

# Corrected Code for Maximum Flow using Ford-Fulkerson

# Example usage
m = MaximumFlow([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

m.add_edge(1, 2, 4)
m.add_edge(1, 3, 6)
m.add_edge(2, 3, 8)
m.add_edge(2, 4, 3)

# Explanation of Changes:
# Flow Initialization: The self.graph[(i, j)] = 0 initializes all edge flows to zero, representing an empty graph with no flow initially.

# Finding Augmenting Paths: The method add_flow performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the source node. It attempts to send as much flow as possible along any available path until the sink node is reached.

# Residual Capacity Adjustment: After finding an augmenting path, we reduce the capacity of each edge in the path by the flow found, and we increase the reverse flow (for possible future flow adjustments).

# Termination: The while-loop continues until no more augmenting paths can be found (i.e., when add_flow returns 0, meaning no more flow can be added).

# Example Breakdown:
# For the given graph:

# Edges:

# 1 -> 2 with capacity 4

# 1 -> 3 with capacity 6

# 2 -> 3 with capacity 8

# 2 -> 4 with capacity 3

# 3 -> 5 with capacity 4

# 4 -> 5 with capacity 5

# The algorithm would explore augmenting paths and incrementally send flow until no more paths can be found. In this case, the result is 7, which is the maximum flow from node 1 (source) to node 5 (sink).
