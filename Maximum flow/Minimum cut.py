# Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm:
# The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is a greedy algorithm that repeatedly finds augmenting paths from the source node to the sink node and pushes flow along these paths. This process continues until there are no more augmenting paths left (i.e., no path exists where the residual capacity is greater than zero). The algorithm guarantees that the flow value computed at the end is a maximum flow if certain conditions (e.g., integer capacities) are met.

# Maximum Flow:
# The maximum flow from a source node to a sink node is the largest possible amount of flow that can be sent from the source to the sink in a flow network while respecting the capacity limits of the edges.

# Minimum Cut:
# A cut is a partition of the graph's nodes into two disjoint sets, such that the source node is in one set and the sink node is in the other set. The minimum cut is a cut where the sum of the capacities of the edges that cross the partition (from the source set to the sink set) is minimized.

# Relation Between Maximum Flow and Minimum Cut:
# The key insight behind the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm's correctness lies in the relationship between maximum flow and minimum cut, known as the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem. This theorem states that:

# The maximum flow in a flow network is equal to the minimum cut of the network.

# The value of the maximum flow cannot exceed the value of the minimum cut, and vice versa.

# Why Does Ford-Fulkerson Work?
# The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm ensures that the flow reaches the maximum value because of the following key ideas:

# 1. Cuts and Flow:
# Consider any cut of the graph (a set of edges that, if removed, disconnect the source from the sink). Any valid flow from the source to the sink must pass through one of these edges in the cut.

# The flow through the cut cannot exceed the total capacity of the cut edges. This is because the flow is bounded by the capacity of the edges in the network.

# 2. Residual Graph:
# After each augmenting path is found and the flow is pushed along it, the residual graph is updated. In the residual graph, some edges have reduced capacities, and reverse edges are added (to allow for "undoing" the flow if necessary in the future).

# The residual graph reflects the available capacity in the graph after each augmentation of flow.

# 3. Final Flow and Residual Graph:
# Once no more augmenting paths can be found (i.e., there are no residual paths with positive capacity from the source to the sink), we can identify a cut based on the nodes that are reachable from the source in the residual graph. This set of reachable nodes defines the source side of the cut.

# Any edge that crosses from the reachable set (source side) to the non-reachable set (sink side) in the residual graph will have zero residual capacity (meaning it is fully saturated).

# The sum of the capacities of these edges in the original graph defines the capacity of the cut, which will be equal to the value of the flow computed by the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.

# 4. Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem:
# Since the value of the flow in the network is the sum of the flows along all edges in the flow network, and since no flow can exceed the value of the minimum cut, it follows that:

# Maximum Flow
# =
# Minimum Cut
# Maximum Flow=Minimum Cut
# The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm ensures that the computed flow is equal to the maximum flow because, by finding augmenting paths and pushing flow along them, the algorithm progressively "saturates" the edges in the minimum cut.

# Constructing a Minimum Cut:
# After the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm completes (i.e., no more augmenting paths can be found), we can construct the minimum cut as follows:

# Identify Reachable Nodes: Perform a DFS or BFS starting from the source node in the residual graph. The nodes reachable from the source in the residual graph are the nodes on the source side of the cut.

# Find Cut Edges: Any edge that goes from a reachable node to a non-reachable node (across the cut) will have a residual capacity of zero in the residual graph (indicating the flow has "saturated" that edge).

# Sum the Capacities: The edges that cross the cut represent the minimum cut, and their total capacity equals the value of the maximum flow.

# Example:
# Consider the following graph with the following capacities:

#     4       6       8
#  (1) --> (2) --> (3) --> (5)
#      \         /
#       \       /
#        v     v
#         (4) 

# Edges and Capacities:

# 1 → 2 (capacity 4)

# 1 → 3 (capacity 6)

# 2 → 3 (capacity 8)

# 2 → 4 (capacity 3)

# 3 → 5 (capacity 4)

# 4 → 5 (capacity 5)

# The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm would find augmenting paths and gradually increase the flow until no more augmenting paths can be found. In this case, the maximum flow is 7, which is the value of the minimum cut. The cut might consist of the edges 2 → 4 (capacity 3) and 3 → 5 (capacity 4), which have a total capacity of 7.

# Why This Works:
# The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm finds a flow, and the residual graph is used to construct a cut.

# The residual graph guarantees that no more flow can be pushed after saturation.

# By the Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem, the flow is equal to the minimum cut, and thus we can be confident that the algorithm provides the maximum flow solution.
