# Efficient Algorithms
Overview
This section covers how to design and analyze efficient algorithms. Efficiency matters because it determines how fast and scalable an algorithm is. We'll explore key concepts through practical examples like stock trading, bit strings, and list manipulation.

## Outline of an Efficient Algorithm
An efficient algorithm solves a problem using minimal time and resources. It avoids unnecessary computations and leverages patterns or properties in the data.

Key steps:

Understand the problem deeply.

Identify a brute-force solution.

Look for ways to optimize it using better data structures or logic.

Analyze the time and space complexity.

## Stock Trading
This example introduces a common problem: finding the best time to buy and sell a stock to maximize profit.

Naive approach: Check every pair of days (O(n²)).
Efficient solution: Scan once and track the minimum price seen so far (O(n)).

This teaches how to track values dynamically while iterating through data.

## Is the Algorithm Correct?
An algorithm must not only be fast but also correct.

Verification steps:

Check if it produces the right result for various inputs (including edge cases).

Use assertions or write tests.

Analyze whether it logically covers all cases.

Think about invariants—what stays true throughout the algorithm.

## Bit String
A bit string is a sequence consisting of 0s and 1s.

Common problems include:

Counting the number of 1s.

Finding the longest sequence of 0s or 1s.

Flipping bits to achieve a goal.

Bit strings often appear in optimization and binary-based problems. Efficient algorithms for these tasks usually run in linear time.


## List Splitting
This refers to dividing a list into parts under certain constraints (e.g., equal sum, max size, etc.).

Efficient techniques involve:

Prefix sums

Binary search

Greedy methods

These problems help build skills for partitioning and balancing data.

## Sublists
A sublist is a contiguous portion of a list.

Common tasks:

Finding sublists with a certain sum.

Maximum sublist (Kadane’s algorithm)

Sliding window techniques

Efficient handling of sublists often uses cumulative sums or two-pointer approaches to reduce time complexity from O(n²) to O(n).
